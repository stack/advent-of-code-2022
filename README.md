Warren Moore has two sites, [Metal By Example][metal-by-example] and [Thirty Days of Metal][thirty-days-of-metal], which
were both instrumental in learning how perform rendering in Metal.

[Learn OpenGL][learn-opengl] has a great series on Physically Based Rendering.

[Stone Block][stone-block], [Shiba][shiba], and [Viking Room][viking-room] were obtained via [Sketchfab][sketchfab].
